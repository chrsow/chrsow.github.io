<h2>Score : 400 </h2>


Actually, I'm not familar with forensics challenge, but I can't solve the other challenges and many players have solved this one, made me want to try.

After download the image, mount it first, and looking around.
{% highlight code%}
wasin:dtrump$ mount dtrump.img /mnt/dtrump
wasin:dtrump$ ls -a
.             Desktop           .gitconfig     Music        Templates
..            .dmrc             .gnupg         Pictures     Videos
.bash_logout  Documents         .history       .profile     .viminfo
.bashrc       Downloads         .ICEauthority  Public       .Xauthority
.cache        examples.desktop  .local         rr_moved     .xsession-errors
.config       .gconf            .mozilla       secretfiles
{% endhighlight %}

"secretfiles" folder are interesting, and we see the file with [gpg][gpg] encryption.
{% highlight code%}


wasin:secretfiles$ ls -a
.  ..  document.txt  .git  README.md  Workbook1.xlsx.gpg
{% endhighlight %}

I think flag must be somewhere in the 'Workbook1.xlsx.gpg', the next target is to find the 'key' to decrypt it. So I find out more on another file 'document.txt','README.md','.git' , and I found a clue in '.git' folder.

{% highlight code%}
wasin:secretfiles$ cd .git/
wasin:.git$ ls -a
.   branches        config       HEAD   index  logs     refs
..  COMMIT_EDITMSG  description  hooks  info   objects
wasin:.git$ cat config
[core]
	repositoryformatversion = 0
	filemode = true
	bare = false
	logallrefupdates = true
[remote "origin"]
	url = https://github.com/rc3club/supersecret.git
	fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
[branch "master"]
	remote = origin
	merge = refs/heads/master
{% endhighlight %}

After followed the link 'https://github.com/rc3club/supersecret.git', Finally we found his private key in his reposity. (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rc3club/supersecret/master/private.key)
(in reality, it is a bad idea to keep the private key publicly).

Last time I involved with gpg encrytion/decryption was in computer security class, miss it so much, and with some problem with read-only file on Ubuntu made me can't download private key. So I switched to Windows and decrypt the file.
{% highlight code%}
bash-3.1$ gpg --allow-secret-key-import --import private.key
gpg: key 8FFDF6D6: secret key imported
gpg: key 8FFDF6D6: public key "ThugG (lolz) <nope@gmail.com>" imported
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:               imported: 1  (RSA: 1)
gpg:       secret keys read: 1
gpg:   secret keys imported: 1
bash-3.1$ gpg -d Workbook1.xlsx.gpg > Workbook1.xlsx
gpg: encrypted with 1024-bit RSA key, ID E22CB12D, created 2016-11-18
      "ThugG (lolz) <nope@gmail.com>"
{% endhighlight %}

After opened the file. it prompt for the password, what is the password?. I take a look in 'secretfiles' folder and doubt that password must be in 'document.txt' (passowrd123) or 'README.txt'(# supersecret). Both are wrong, so I guess may be 'passowrd123' was mispelling from 'password123' and this is the right guess.

I can't find the flag, so I decide to take a look at the other files and directorys and found nothing. The next day I get back to check this file again, finally it is not so complicated as much as I think. It is on the second sheet which I have alredy
search. Because It is in white color, but you can see it on funciton tab above.
